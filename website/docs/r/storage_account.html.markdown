  location = "westus"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "testsa" {
  name                     = "storageaccountname"
  resource_group_name      = "${azurerm_resource_group.testrg.name}"
  location                 = "westus"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"

  tags {
    environment = "staging"
  }
}
```

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to
    create the storage account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the
    resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `account_kind` - (Optional) Defines the Kind of account. Valid options are `Storage`
    and `BlobStorage`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Defaults
    to `Storage`.

* `account_replication_type` - (Required) Defines the type of replication to use for this storage account. Valid options are `LRS`, `GRS`, `RAGRS` and `ZRS`.

* `access_tier` - (Required for `BlobStorage` accounts) Defines the access tier
    for `BlobStorage` accounts. Valid options are `Hot` and `Cold`, defaults to
    `Hot`.

* `enable_blob_encryption` - (Optional) Boolean flag which controls if Encryption
    Services are enabled for Blob storage, see [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-service-encryption/)
    for more information.
